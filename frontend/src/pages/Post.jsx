      <p>
        Buying your first home is a major milestone and one of the most significant financial decisions you'll make. 
        This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the entire process, from initial budgeting to closing the deal, 
        ensuring you make informed decisions every step of the way.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Budget Planning</h2>
      <p>
        Before you start house hunting, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of your finances. Always plan your 
        budget including not just the property price, but also registration fees, stamp duty, legal costs, and ongoing 
        maintenance expenses. A general rule of thumb is that your home loan EMI should not exceed 40% of your monthly income.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Location Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Location is perhaps the most important factor in real estate. Choose areas with good infrastructure, connectivity, 
        schools, hospitals, and future growth potential. Research upcoming infrastructure projects, metro lines, and commercial 
        developments that could increase property value over time.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Legal Verification</h2>
      <p>
        Never skip legal verification. Ensure the property has clear title deeds, approved building plans, and all necessary 
        permissions from local authorities. Hire a reputable lawyer to verify all documents before making any payments.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Home Loan Pre-approval</h2>
      <p>
        Getting pre-approved for a home loan gives you a clear budget and makes you a more attractive buyer. Compare interest 
        rates from different banks and choose the best option. Don't forget to factor in processing fees and other charges.
